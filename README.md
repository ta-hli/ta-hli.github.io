## Editing the TAHLI website

You don't need to setup anything to edit the site, just log in to GitHub and start adding/editing pages. (Your GitHub account will need write permissions on the repository.)

For example, to edit the main page [click here](https://github.com/ta-hli/ta-hli/edit/main/about.md)

Here's a GitHub guide on adding new pages (fixed links) and posts (dated content): \

3. Install ruby (programming language and runtime): ```sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev```
4. Install bundler (package manager) and jekyll (the site generator): ```gem install bundler jekyll```
5. Run the site: ```bundle exec jekyll serve```

## Miscellaneous GitHub Pages info

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ta-hli/ta-hli/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes
